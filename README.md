# Face Detection Exercise

Learning to use different pre-built models for face detection in Python.

## Research Questions

- Do these face detection models work on animated faces?
- Do they work when a person is wearing sunglasses?

## Description of contents

- Four photos to test face detection (2 group shots, one with sunglasses, one with animated faces)
- face_detect.py uses OpenCV cascade classifier 
- face_detect_mtcnn.py uses a [Python-based MTCNN project](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn)
